"""
Write a Python function named morse_translator that translates a given string into Morse code.

Each alphabetic character in the string should be translated to its corresponding Morse code equivalent.
The Morse code for each character should be separated by a space.
Each word in the string should be separated by a forward slash (/).
The function should handle both uppercase and lowercase alphabetic characters.
The function should be case-insensitive, meaning it treats uppercase and lowercase letters the same.
Non-alphabetic characters (like numbers or symbols) should not be translated.

Write a Python function named case_counter that counts the number of uppercase and lowercase letters in a given string.

Non-alphabetic characters in the string should be ignored and not counted.

Write a Python function named speeding_ticket that evaluates whether a driver should receive a speeding ticket based on their driving speed and a special condition (their birthday).

The function should return one of three strings based on the driver's speed: "No Ticket", "Small Ticket", or "Big Ticket".
If the driver's speed is 60 mph or less, they should receive "No Ticket".
If the driver's speed is between 61 and 80 mph inclusive, they should receive a "Small Ticket".
If the driver's speed is 81 mph or more, they should receive a "Big Ticket".
On the driver's birthday, the speed limits for each ticket category are increased by 5 mph. For example, they can go up to 65 mph and still receive "No Ticket" if it is their birthday.
